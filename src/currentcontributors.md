# Contributors to the Rari Capital Ecosystem

## How does our DAO work?

The beauty of a decentralized and non-custodial protocol like Rari Capital is that one person does not have the capability to shut down the system. All of the smart contracts are currently on a multi-sig managed by the founding members and now core contributors. Once on-chain governance is fully audited and deployed, $RGT holders will manage all smart contract upgrades through on-chain votes. 

Decentralized autonomous organizations are relatively new to our state of technological evolution and while you may not be too familiar with the framework and structure, they allow contributors all over the world from all different backgrounds to work towards one goal: *Maximzing the value of the community.* While we have a community of over 9,500 RGT holders, 5,000 users across all products, and 7,000 Discord members, the following individuals work every single day to grow and develop this ecosystem.

Do you want to get involved? The community would love to have you! Reach out to a current contributor in the Discord and we will find a place for you.
