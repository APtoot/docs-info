# DAO Structure

## The bubbles

Each DAO will likely have their own organization structure but for Rari Capital, each task we pursue can be split into three main categories: 

1. **Operations:** Overseeing the protocol’s maintenance and conducting active management on the products. 
2. **Strategy:** Ensuring that the protocol grows and stays competitive on a macro-scale. 
3. **Development:** Developing and securing each of the products and protocols. 

While these are the core categories, they are not very specific. For that, bubbles function as these working groups on specific overarching goals. Think of those three categories as large bubbles and these are each smaller bubbles within each of them. Below, you can find each of the small bubbles for the categories outlined above: 

1. **Operations:** Legal, Relationship Upkeep, Marketing (Social, Education, Partnerships), Security Coordination, Design, Community Management, Contributor Management
2. **Strategy:** Protocol Design, Risk Assessment, Treasury Management, Bridge, Direct TVL Growth
3. **Development:** Security Tooling, Smart Contract, Developer Relations, Internal Tools, UI

A bubble has a few main pieces: 

1. **Mission:** The goal of the bubble, what it hopes to accomplish on a larger time scale. 
2. **KPI’s:** The key performance indicators of that bubble. These can be quantitive or qualitative but need to be outlined on the creation of a bubble. Created by the lead and consistently (bi-weekly) tracked in a public environment. 
3. **Lead:** The constituents of a bubble must vote on a lead. This person is responsible for hitting those KPI’s and ensuring the bubble hits its goals. This person can be voted out at anytime and if not their bubble may fork away. This person has no meaningful power over the other individuals in the bubble.

The bubble organization enables accountability while maintaining a rather flat organization. I will also note that anybody can **“fork” a bubble and spin off their own “working group” on any topic if they feel that the current bubble is not fit for them. All that is needed to create a new bubble in general is sheer motivation.** I imagine that in the future there will be many, say “Design” bubbles, within the organization. This is a future where the protocol is not reliant on one individual but rather runs on bubbles.

## The Details of a Bubble

Just because individuals are in bubbles, it doesn’t mean that the constituents will instantly be accountable. That is where the “Log” comes into place. The “Log” is a public accountability document where anybody can instantly view the performance of each bubble. It pushes for condensed knowledge while enabling each bubble to demonstrate their work with everyone.

You can easily track along with the Rari Capital Log [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1szcMBcOcQcmmzZwtCv_akrcXaluPxRZSDVDrk_jGCRc/edit?usp=sharing), in public. General insight like this will lead to much easier decisions (hiring/firing/compensation) for the rest of the DAO. 

Lastly as bubbles need resources, they will work with treasury management on exploring what is possible and putting together a governance proposal for the DAO. 

## Grants

The grants that Samuel has designed [here](https://forums.rari.capital/d/89-introducing-grant-station) play a central role in the scaling of the DAO. These grants enable individuals to dip their toes into working with the current set of contributors and enable them to earn RGT with minimal long term commitment. Completing a grant will make subsequent potential applications to working for the DAO a lot simpler as it provides a clear track record of working on protocol related activities. The grant program will continue to run and grow alongside the rest of the organization. 

## Talent Inflow and Retention 

The Rari Protocol needs to maintain access to the top talent in the ecosystem without forfeiting itself by making the recruitment process burdensome. The talent process can be split into the following 4 stages: 

1. **Search / talent capture:** finding the top talent and attracting them directly to the DAO. 
2. **Talent applications:** getting data on the talent to ensure that they are a fit and placed in the right bubble(s). 
3. **Onboarding the talent:** having the talent file for a formal application to the DAO, bringing them into the contributor Discord, etc. 
4. **Keeping the talent:** continually providing benefits to the talent within the DAO. 

I propose, that we do the following regarding how talent is handled within the DAO, split up by stage: 

**Search / talent capture:**

- Each member of the DAO is encouraged to help with talent search by utilizing their own personal networks. 
- The DAO can optionally pursue formal recruiters depending on future governance proposals. 

**Talent applications:**

- A public (all data is public) form will be circulated to all potential members of the DAO. It is modeled after [OlympusDAO’s form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjvAUOwN9qGmV_vaqJUFxmL8iKwEvRMyPMvCHHp1wU3KQUjg/viewform) and you can view a draft [here](https://forms.gle/Yp3timZKkU8EkMiL6) (fill it out if you’re interested!). A spreadsheet will be created to publicize the data to everyone as applications come in. 
- An individual within the recruiting team bubble will formally review each applicant to the DAO and work with them on the next application steps to provide a “formal verification” of an individual. 
- An individual, formally verified or not, may then follow [proper governance guidelines](https://www.notion.so/rari/How-to-Make-a-Governance-Proposal-f11a43bb31de491bbc29a69373a0e687) to fully onboard into the DAO following the example set up by Samuel Shadrach [here](https://forums.rari.capital/d/56-rip-24-collaboration-with-samuel-shadrach). Individuals may opt to try a trial period like Samuel to prove themselves (and make sure they like working for the DAO) and be more likely to be onboarded by the DAO. 

*The DAO is unlikely to onboard any individuals who have not done at least one of the following: 1) received formal verification from a recruitment member, 2) completed a trial period or 3) completed a grant for the protocol.* 

I would also like the DAO to further explore the creation of a “Council” who will be able to handle salaries for each individuals privately. The council’s budget and creation would be based on future governance proposal’s. This will likely become a necessity as the protocol grows. 

**Onboarding the talent:**

- A member from the recruitment bubble will reach out and add the individual to the Contributor Discord (talked about later) once they have been approved. 
- Once you are a part of the DAO, you will work with current collaborators on which bubbles you will join. 

**Keeping the talent:**

- The recruitment bubble should be well funded enough to be able to reward the strongest members of the organization. These rewards can be ranging gifts all the way from an AMC Gift Card to a $RGT bonus. This proposal doesn’t dive deep into the mechanics of this but aims to explore it in further work here. 

## Compensation

The Rari Capital DAO should be an extremely aggressive and competent actor when it comes to compensation. While obviously, at the end of the day, it is up to the talent to decide on what they’d like to ask to the DAO, the recruiting bubble may provide insight (based on historical data and industry standards) into “suggested amounts.” 

To set the stage clear, currently, the Rari Capital DAO has little to no stables and ETH. The Rari Capital DAO is largely allocated into RGT. Though, this may change in the future via a fundraise. I believe once the protocol is able to pay salaries in stables, then the tokens should be vested for a minimum of 3 years when doing work for the DAO. In the meantime, direct RGT payments are the only way to stay competitive. 

## Ending Bad Talent (aka Firing) / Accountability

Bad talent came from a multitude of places like: 

- Inability to perform and deliver on key deliverables 
- Inability to collaborate with fellow contributors 

But it is something that must be dealt with and planned around. For this reason, I propose that the DAO sets a clear way that this be handled. 

It is likely that the current contributor set will be the first to realize the bad talent. It is for this reason, that the contributor set will have a monthly set of surveys that will be used to gauge key metrics: how is each contributor in their bubble contributing? how do each of the contributors get along? This survey will be exclusively viewed by the recruiting bubble and no actions will be taken on it (view sample [here](https://forms.gle/esjzr7Lkf4PXCGcK6)). 

The recruiting bubble will then consult members who have been flagged (for one of the many afforementioned issues). If a member has been flagged multiple times, either an individual of their bubble or the recruiting team may begin the governance process to terminate the flagged members. 

However, in order for this to work effectively, standards need to be created by the DAO. There needs to be clear expectations of every individual (culturally and work-related) to ensure that everyone is on the same page. 

## Social & Cultural Expectations

The Rari Capital DAO is focused on building the future of finance. At our core, the mission is to ***deliver the most yield to the most people\****.* This is a *social* mission that will most likely change the lives of many (if done correctly!) so I believe social change should be at the core of the protocol. I encourage fellow contributors to engage in conversations about social issues and the role that our DAO can play in helping the world. That being said, these issues should not distract or detract from protocol work, it should be used to fuel us, never to divide us.

Each member of the DAO should be working at their highest degree of productivity. If not, they need to understand the potential consequences. Additionally, communication is key in the DAO. Make everything clear to fellow contributors, if you are struggling, if you are thriving, if you need something — let everybody (specifically your bubbles) know so that we are all on the same page. 

## **Contributor Communications**

There is already the Rari Capital DAO Discord. This serves as a way for members of our community to discuss various things and also serves as a platform for the contributors to discuss with the community. However, this is not the place for contributors to stay focused. 

For this reason, there has been the creation of the Rari Capital Team/Contributors Discord. This Discord is solely dedicated to people who are somehow contributing to any part of the Rari Capital stack. Upon joining, they are able to select which series of channels they want to be part of: development, operations or strategy (or they can choose multiple; also note how these match the previously defined categories). While each bubble could have its own channel, I suggest for bubbles to try and merge and have overlapping channels to prevent way too many being created. 

Members will onboard into this Discord server in one of two ways: 

- After being approved for a grant 
- After being onboarded into the DAO

This serves as an easy communications platform for all contributors. The contributors may exploring a hierarchy model based on duration of contribution, however, this is not necessary at the moment. 

Each member actively contributing to the DAO (and being paid as so) is expected to complete a daily standup in the #standup channel for all working days. 

One thing that the DAO *could* explore down the line would be a hierarchy of contributors. The hierarchy would be based on time contributing and the monthly performance reviews. This would be beneficial to the organization once it has reached peak communications, but that is unlikely to happen before *30-ish* people, so we don’t have to worry about this yet + I am still personally conflicted about this.
