# Making a proposal

A governance proposal may attempt to:

- Get signalling in favour of some off-chain proposal
- Execute changes on-chain

It is highly recommended that all proposals are first posted to the forum for at least 2 days. Proposals must follow the [proposal format](#proposal-format).

After this, proposals may go for vote. Proposals that only require RGT holders to signal in favour can be posted for a 2-day vote on Snapshot.

Proposals that directly execute changes on-chain are posted through on-chain governance via GovernorBravo. For a full scope of what is controlled on-chain, see [On-chain governance and upgradeability](https://info.rari.capital/governance/on-chain/).

- **Background:** Provide context to the problem your proposal wishes to address or to the area of the protocol you intend to improve.
- **Abstract:** Clearly describe how the proposal wishes to change/improve the protocol.
- **Motivation:** Explain why this proposal is necessary or useful for the protocol.

**For:** Illustrate in one or two sentences what this position supports.
