# Decentralized Exchange Liquidty Incentives (Pool2)

## Overview

The Rari Capital DAO is incentizing decentralized exchange liquidity of RGT on [Sushiswap](Sushi.com). Once you stake both RGT and ETH on Sushiswap in the [RGT-ETH Pool](https://app.sushi.com/add/ETH/0xd291e7a03283640fdc51b121ac401383a46cc623), you can stake your SLP tokens on the Pool2 dashboard to earn RGT rewards. 

## How to Deposit

If you do not have a wallet, we recommend you refer to [this guide ](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-Started-With-MetaMask-Part-1)for [MetaMask](Metamask.io).

**Step 3: Withdraw into a supported asset**

After choosing a pool and selecting the transaction button, users can then toggle the withdrawal function with the gear button in the top right. Then, select any of the supported crypto-assets and withdraw from the pool. This can be done by selecting the asset menu, choosing your desired asset, the amount, and by pressing the "Withdraw" button.

It is worth noting that it will cost less gas to withdraw in any tokens currently active within the protocol, as it will require fewer swaps. Conversely, this means that it will require more gas for withdrawals in assets not currently active.
