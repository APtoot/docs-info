# Safeguarded Launches 

Rari Capital begun its stealth model in April 2020. By June 2020, the Rari Capital protocol had undergone a security review by Quantstamp and reviews by other 3rd parties, but we knew that wasn't enough. In July, we launched Rari V1, which optimized lending across two major protocols: Compound Finance and dYdX, as well as rebalancing between stablecoins using 0x. This version had a deposit limit of $350 to ensure user security. Some of the other ways that we take security seriously include:

- Assessing each underlying protocol prior to integration (link to assessment framework [here](https://www.notion.so/Rari-Strategy-Assessment-Framework-2d1edffcf80f4750973f6e90e97b70a4))
- Deposit limit scaling up over time
- Transparent posts
- Open sourced
- Community focused
- Veteran contributors in crypto and DeFi
- Audits

The following months after the launch, we gradually increased the deposit limits in response to our successful audits and the total supply in the protocol.

By October, we unlocked all deposit limits and enabled liquidity mining. Please remember that not all risks are avoidable in DeFi and there are always inherent risks. This is highly experiemntal technology. Please take caution when depositing into protocols. Only deposit what you are willing to lose.
