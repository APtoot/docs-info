# Safeguarded Launches 

Security and risk management has and will always be top priority at Rari Capital. Following a guide outlined by [Ken Deeter](https://medium.com/electric-capital/derisking-defi-guarded-launches-2600ce730e0a), we have ensured that every single new product follow our safeguarded approach.The following attributes promote our care towards safety of all our users and ecosystem members:

- Assessing each underlying protocol prior to integration (link to assessment framework [here](https://www.notion.so/Rari-Strategy-Assessment-Framework-2d1edffcf80f4750973f6e90e97b70a4))
- Deposit limit scaling up over time
- Transparent posts
- Open sourced
- Community focused
- Veteran contributors in crypto and DeFi
- Audits

Every product that launches under Rari Capital goes through its own version of a guarded launch. This has been brought to life from deposit and borrow limits in both the Yield Aggregator and Fuse, and we will continue to slowly unveil all of our upcoming products with safety always top of mind.
