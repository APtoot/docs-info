# Tranches With Saffron Finance

## Overview

The Rari Capital DAI pool is integrated within [Saffron Finance](Saffron.Finance), a protocol pioneering in risk mitigation and steady interest rates across DeFi. Users who deposit into these tranches receive guaranted rates as well as [SFI](Coingecko.com/SFI) (Saffron's token) emmissions as added incentives for provifing liquidity. 

Starting, December 27th at 6am UTC, users begun providing liquidity to the [Saffron/Rari DAI adapter pool](https://app.saffron.finance/#liquidity) as part of [Epoch 4](https://medium.com/saffron-finance/saffron-epoch-4-85dda2f9e0bb). 

## **About Saffron Finance**

Launched in October 2020, the development team at Saffron Finance have come together to deliver a brilliant innovation in the decentralized finance sector. This decentralized protocol optimizes yield for users contributing liquidity with various predetermined tranches set at different risk levels. These tranches are set to two week epochs, where those contributing liquidity across the provided pairs receive payouts in exchange for locking their funds up for two weeks. Saffron successfully mitigates significant effects of impermanent loss by categorizing risk and return while allowing its users to choose their risk level.

## **What does this mean for Rari Capital users?**

Saffron Finance has opened up a DAI tranche specifically designed for Rariâ€™s new DAI pool! Why would they do this? The Rari Capital DAI Pool lends across multiple lending protocols, including Fuse, and is constantly rebalancing and optimizing for the highest yield possible. **This is very special for users in DeFi as this is the first known tranche that allows anyone to take advantage of a yield aggregator, like Rari Capital, performing as the underlying interest generating machine within the trance.**

As part of this partnership, Saffron Finance has integrated the Rari DAI Pool into their tranche offerings and us at Rari Capital designed and built our own interface to easily interact with the latest tranche.

Whether you use the Saffron Finance website or the Rari Capital portal, you will easily be able to deposit/withdraw/track all of your positions!

*Note: Saffron Finance follows an Epoch schedule, meaning every two weeks you must withdraw and re-deposit (if you wish to stay), in order to maintain your interest earning potential*

## Liquidity Incentives

The DAI/Rari pool is incentivized with a new amount of SFI every two weeks! This means that all deposits into this trance will be rewarded with SFI distributions throughout each epoch!
